# poc-xbz


To run on WIndows, just open the file `main.py` and add cnpj and xbz token.


After that, you can run the file `main.py` directly or, if you are using Windows, you can run our bat file and make a simple starting configuration isolating the Python version that will run the script.

In case you run the script directly, be sure to install the dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
